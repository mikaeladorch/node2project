For this repository, I created an interactive self care act randomizer for users that are looking for different ways to self heal. 

It starts off by asking the viewer to click the screen until their favorite ice cream flavor image, from a random array, pops up. The data I chose to gather the ice cream flavor images was by searching America's favorite ice cream flavors from a news survey study. I chose ice cream as the icebreaker subject because most people love and indulge in ice cream when tough times occur.

Following along the left random ice cream image is a text prompt that reads "Treat yourself to:" Furthermore, on the bottom right corner of the screen there is a button that prompts self care acts, which connects to "treating yourself" to sweet ice cream and a positive action for yourself.

All of the mouse/button functions are randomly infinite, so there a various combinations to ice cream images and self care acts the user can choose from.
